# Backend

For Pharmacy: <br>
The pharmacies have the option of registering themselves on the WebApp. After registering successfully, the pharmacies can add as well as delete a medicine, depending on the availability of the medicine. The pharmacies can further update the stock of their medicines as and when required. When a customer is in need of a medicine, he will be suggested to go to the pharmacy closest to him which has the medicine. This promotes the pharmacy owners to constantly keep available the important medicines so that they do not miss out on the local business opportunities. This will increase the business of the pharmacies as more of the local crowd which was not aware of the shop will now start doing transactions with it. Many more people who encounter emergencies in the area will tend to go to the nearest pharmacy to them.
